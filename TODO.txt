- Get the thing
    - User invokes the bot, provides a category, and writes a message
    - Bot is invoked
    - Bot randomly chooses a picture based on the category
    - Bot attaches the caption to the picture.
    - Bot sends the picture to the server

- Create Help command (customize for slash commands)
- create stats command

- Add file size check # YO Tried replicating the file size check from the last bot, but lightbulb doesn't like it for some reason
